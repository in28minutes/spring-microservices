### Introduction

Developing RESTful web services is fun. The combination of Spring Boot, Spring Web MVC, Spring Web Services and JPA makes it even more fun. And its even more fun to create Microservices.

There are two parts to this course - RESTful web services and Microservices

Architectures are moving towards microservices. 

RESTful web services are the first step to developing great microservices. Spring Boot, in combination with Spring Web MVC (also called Spring REST) makes it easy to develop RESTful web services. 

In the first part of the course, you will learn the basics of RESTful web services developing resources for a social media application. You will learn to implement these resources with multiple features - versioning, exception handling, documentation (Swagger), basic authentication (Spring Security), filtering and HATEOAS. You will learn the best practices in designing RESTful web services.

In this part of the course, you will be using Spring (Dependency Management), Spring MVC (or Spring REST), Spring Boot, Spring Security (Authentication and Authorization), Spring Boot Actuator (Monitoring), Swagger (Documentation), Maven (dependencies management), Eclipse (IDE), Postman (REST Services Client) and Tomcat Embedded Web Server. We will help you set up each one of these.

In the second part of the course, you will learn the basics of Microservices. You will understand how to implement microservices using Spring Cloud.

In this part of the course, you will learn to establish communication between microservices, enable load balancing, scaling up and down of microservices. You will also learn to centralize configuration of microservices with Spring Cloud Config Server. You will implement Eureka Naming Server and Distributed tracing with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin. You will create fault toleranct microservices with Zipkin


### You will learn
- You will be able to develop and design RESTful web services
- You will setup Centralized Microservice Configuration with Spring Cloud Config Server
- You will understand how to implement Exception Handling, Validation, HATEOAS and filtering for RESTful Web Services.
- You will implement client side load balancing (Ribbon), Dynamic scaling(Eureka Naming Server) and an API Gateway (Zuul)
- You will learn to implement Distributed tracing for microservices with Spring Cloud Sleuth and Zipkin
- You will implement Fault Tolerance for microservices with Zipkin
- You will understand how to version your RESTful Web Services
- You will understand how to monitor RESTful Services with Spring Boot Actuator
- You will understand how to document RESTful Web Services with Swagger
- You will understand the best practices in designing RESTful web services
- Using Spring Cloud Bus to exchange messages about Configuration updates
- Simplify communication with other Microservices using Feign REST Client


### Step Wise Details
Refer each steps

### Expectations
- You should know Java and Spring. 
- A basic understanding of developing web applications is a bonus but NOT mandatory. 
- A basic understanding of Spring Boot is a bonus but NOT mandatory. We have seperate section to introduce Spring Boot.
- A basic understanding of JPA is a bonus but NOT mandatory. We have seperate section to introduce JPA.
- You are NOT expected to have any experience with Eclipse, Maven or Tomcat.
- We will help you install Eclipse and get up and running with Maven and Tomcat.

## About in28Minutes
- At in28Minutes, we ask ourselves one question everyday. How do we help you learn effectively - that is more quickly and retain more of what you have learnt?
- We use Problem-Solution based Step-By-Step Hands-on Approach With Practical, Real World Application Examples. 
- Our success on Udemy and Youtube (2 Million Views & 12K Subscribers) speaks volumes about the success of our approach.
- While our primary expertise is on Development, Design & Architecture Java & Related Frameworks (Spring, Struts, Hibernate) we are expanding into the front-end world (Bootstrap, JQuery, Angular JS). 

### Our Beliefs
- Best Courses are interactive and fun.
- Foundations for building high quality applications are best laid down while learning.

### Our Approach
- Problem Solution based Step by Step Hands-on Learning
- Practical, Real World Application Examples.
- We use 80-20 Rule. We discuss 20% things used 80% of time in depth. We touch upon other things briefly equipping you with enough knowledge to find out more on your own. 
- We will be developing a demo application in the course, which could be reused in your projects, saving hours of your effort.
- We love open source and therefore, All our code is open source too and available on Github.
